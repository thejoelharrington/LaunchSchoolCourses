#create a new enumerator object. I will define what values are iterated upon. this enumerator should be able to iterate over a list of factorials starting with zero factorial 0!.

#print first 7 factorials with an external iterator.
#print 3 more factorials (theyll be incorrect)
#reset enumerator with #rewind method, and print 7 more factorials.

=begin
Enumerator, specifically, is a class in Ruby that allows both types of iterations â€“ external and internal. Internal iteration refers to the form of iteration which is controlled by the class in question, while external iteration means that the environment or the client controls the way iteration is performed.
